Description:

 

    31 x 8 RAM for scratchpad data storage
    Serial I/O interface for minimum pin count
    Wide Working Voltage: 2.0 ~ 5.5V
    Single-byte and multi-byte transmission for clock or RAM data read / write
    TTL-compatible (Vcc=5V)
    Working Temperature: 0 to +70 Deg C
    32.768KHz crystal oscillator
    Equipped with a 260mAh CR2032 button battery, not rechargeable
    Overall Size: Approx. 44 x 23 x 11mm

Wiring:

    Vcc - +5V / 3.3V
    GND - GND
    CLK - P01
    DAT - P02
    RST - P00

Note:

    Do not reverse VCC and GND, or it will cause damage
    It requires a pull-up resistor for P0 port of 51 MCU, if without, you can connect the data cable to other terminal
